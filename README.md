# FOLLOW_of_grammar
An edited version of someone else's code I got on github (they are given credit inside of the program). Looks through a grammar and finds whatever will appear first and second (follow). The input file is were the grammar should be written. The input file already has an example in it to show how the grammar should be formatted. Once run the code will print the answer.
